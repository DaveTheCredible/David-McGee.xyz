      <description><![CDATA[<p><em>(all of this is very silly and none of it ought to be taken seriously)</em></p>
<p>Whether the glass is half empty or half full is and has always been a matter of much debate. In a question to answer this age - old question, we first asked the world&rsquo;s philosohpers, then mebers of major religious groups, and (at last, for good measure, we asked several major political figures). This is what they said:</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>In our quest to find out whether the glass was half empty or half full, we first asked the world&rsquo;s great philosophers. Here are their responses.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Leibniz says: This is the fullest of all possible glasses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Schopenhauer says: Everything sucks, including the glass.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thales says: The glass is completely full because the air in the top half is also water.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The mereological nihilist says: There is no glass.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The ontological nihilist says: I couldn&rsquo;t have said it better than the previous guy, except what I think doesn&rsquo;t stop sounding crazy if I spend fifteen minutes explaining it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Aristotle says: The glass is actually half empty but possesses the potentiality to be half full.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Anselm says: In using this vessel as part of thine shitty comedy operation, thou hast offended its unfathomably great honor. (<em>sighs</em>) Looks like we&rsquo;re gonna have to set you on fire, bud.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The logical positivist says: Your question is not only extremely annoying but also utterly meaningless.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Michael Huemer says: It just seems really obvious that the glass is half full.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The panpsychist says: Why don&rsquo;t you just ask him, man?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Plato says: The glass halfway participates in the form of fullness.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>John Rawls says: The glass would agree to be half full.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Spinoza says: On God or nature, you brought me back to life just to ask me that?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The solipsist says: The glass doesn&rsquo;t exist and neither do you. Oh, you disagree with that? That&rsquo;s just what a nonexistent person would say.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lance Bush says: The notion of a &ldquo;full glass&rdquo; is completely unintelligible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The analytic philosopher says: Okay, let&rsquo;s unpack this a little &hellip; [begins a seven hour monologue discussing the precise usage of the terms involved and their history, making heavy use of symbolic logic and Bayes&rsquo; Theorem all the while. His conclusion: &ldquo;I dunno bro, it&rsquo;s probably just semantics or something.&rdquo;]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The continental philosopher says: Hark upon the serendipitous quintessence with which we must congitate upon such a query - multitudinous intrepid spirits hath ruminated upon this antique problem passim the eons; for the portion of this individuated subjectivity, think he that the chalice mays perchance be halfway empty - if considered from a certain point of view, but that, in pure disreflective beingness - if perchance such a thing might there be - the query musts finally remain unanswered; or perhaps there is no that such to be gobbledegooked; perchance instead it be that gobbledebooking shall not maintain apace of the clandestine ruminations liken to &hellip; [he continues on like this for the next fifteen minutes, liberally using many obscure words and several he just made up (as well as all punctuation marks save periods). One of our interns gets the best sleep of her life. Towards the end he begins shouting in French, throws the glass out the window, and faints]</p>

</ul>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>For good measure, we also reached out to several prominent politicians for their thoughts on the matter.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Kamala Harris says: It is in the Venn diagram of glasses which are half empty and glasses which are half full.</p>
</li>
<li>

</li>
<li>
<p>Joe Biden says: what you saying, Jack? &hellip; &ldquo;shabapaqoba?&rdquo; &hellip; Come on, man.</p>
</li>

</li>
<li>

</li>
<li>
<p>Kristie Noem says: I shot the glass.</p>
</li>
</ul>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>We also asked people of all faiths and no faith &ndash; God&rsquo;s gotta have something to say about the great questions of life, right?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The agnostic says: I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The strong agnostic says: You don&rsquo;t know.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The gnostic says: I know, and it makes me feel important, so you don&rsquo;t get to know.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The atheist says: &hellip; [excuse us, we appear to have contacted a brick by mistake &ndash; it lacks a belief in God]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Catholic says: I know that her accidents are those a glass, but in essence this object is obviously Natalie Portman. Damn &hellip; she&rsquo;s so hot &hellip; [looks at glass, eyes glaze over, and begins to drool]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The high - church Anglican says: OMG SISTER, you are SO RIGHT!!! SLAY QUEEN!!! [looks at Catholic, eyes glaze over, and begins to drool]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The low - church Anglican says: Nah girlies, that&rsquo;s too far. Like, the glass is def Natalie Portman, but she&rsquo;s just there in spirit or something.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Jew says: Huh? Why do you people think the glass is Natalie Portman?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Southern Baptist says: She isn&rsquo;t!!! They&rsquo;re wrong!!! It just commemorates her!!! Or something!!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Quaker says: Oh, it might be Natalie Portman, it might not, I don&rsquo;t really care.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An unnamed Presbyterian says: WHAT&rsquo;S WRONG WITH YOU PEOPLE?! You stand there, claiming that this is but a glass, but you know in your heart that it is Natalie Portman. Everybody out there, despite their claims to the contrary, knows perfectly well that this glass is Natalie Portman. [stands back, inclining his head slightly, admiring his unmatched powers to read minds.]</p>
</li>
</ul>
