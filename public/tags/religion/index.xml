      <description><![CDATA[<p>For a while, the Christian apologist Frank Turek would occasionally repost this tweet:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><img src="/blood.png" alt="All the blood drained from the young man&rsquo;s face"></p>
<p>Whether this story is real or apocryphal, Turek is making a <em>very serious</em> point. Many young people abandon Christianity, or at least its historic positions about sexual morality, on account of ingrained horniness.</p>
<p>But, I confess I&rsquo;ve always found the Tweet a little hilarious. And I think it deserves to be parodied and dramatically read until Kingdom come. I&rsquo;ve gotten us started, but don&rsquo;t let that stop you from pitching in!</p>
<hr>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re raising all of these objections because you&rsquo;re sleeping with your girlfriend. Am I right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>All the blood flowed to the young man&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>Frank was wrong.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m rejecting God because he gave me Peyroine&rsquo;s disease.&rdquo;</p>
<hr>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re raising all of these objections because Jim plays the drums so loud, am I right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>All the blood drained from the young aspie&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>He was caught.</p>
<p>He was rejecting God because he couldn&rsquo;t stand God&rsquo;s sound system.</p>
<hr>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re raising all of these objections because you want to keep your foreskin. Am I right?</p>
<p>All the blood drained from the young man&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>He was caught.</p>
<p>He was rejecting Allah because he didn&rsquo;t like Allah&rsquo;s morality.</p>
<hr>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re raising all these objections because you hate bonnets. Am I right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>All the blood drained form the young woman&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>She was caught.</p>
<p>She was rejecting God because she didn&rsquo;t share God&rsquo;s fashion sense.</p>
<hr>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re raising all these objections because you hate weed. Am I right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>All the blood drained from the young man&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>He was caught.</p>
<p>He was rejecting Jah because he didn&rsquo;t like Jah&rsquo;s morality.</p>
<hr>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re raising all of these objections because you want a blood transfusion, am I right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>All the blood drained from the young anemic&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>She was caught.</p>
<p>She was rejecting Jehovah because she didn&rsquo;t want to die.</p>
<hr>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re raising all of these objections because you wear prophylactics. Am I right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>All the blood drained from the old man&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>He was caught.</p>
<p>He was rejecting God because he didn&rsquo;t like God&rsquo;s morality.</p>
<hr>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re raising all of these objections because you&rsquo;re sleeping with your girlfriend. Am I right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Both the eyes rolled in the young man&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>He was pissed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Frank, we&rsquo;ve been through this. I&rsquo;m still ace.&rdquo;</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>In our quest to figure out whether the glass is half empty or half full, we interviewed several people of all faiths and no faith &ndash; God&rsquo;s gotta have something to say about the great questions of life, right?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The agnostic says: I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The strong agnostic says: You don&rsquo;t know.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The gnostic says: I know, and it makes me feel important, so you don&rsquo;t get to know.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The atheist says: &hellip; [excuse us, we appear to have contacted a brick by mistake &ndash; it lacks a belief in God]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Catholic says: I know that her accidents are those a glass, but in essence this object is obviously Natalie Portman. Damn &hellip; she&rsquo;s so hot &hellip; [looks at glass, eyes glaze over, and begins to drool]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The high - church Anglican says: OMG SISTER, you are SO RIGHT!!! SLAY QUEEN!!! [looks at Catholic, eyes glaze over, and begins to drool]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The low - church Anglican says: Nah girlies, that&rsquo;s too far. Like, the glass is def Natalie Portman, but she&rsquo;s just there in spirit or something.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Jew says: Huh? Why do you people think the glass is Natalie Portman?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Southern Baptist says: She isn&rsquo;t!!! They&rsquo;re wrong!!! It just commemorates her!!! Or something!!!</p>
</li>
</ul>
