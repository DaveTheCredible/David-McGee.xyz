      <description><![CDATA[<p><em>(all of this is very silly and none of it ought to be taken seriously)</em></p>
<p>Whether the glass is half empty or half full is and has always been a matter of much debate. In a question to answer this age - old question, we first asked the world&rsquo;s philosohpers, then mebers of major religious groups, and (at last, for good measure, we asked several major political figures). This is what they said:</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>&ldquo;But your honor, I only purchased those five hundred pounds of fertilizer because it tastes so damn good!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your honor, I know I&rsquo;m on the no - fly list, but I was clearly wearing basketball shorts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your honor, I sincerely apologize. I merely forgot that armed robbery is illegal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your honor, I know the light was red, but I only turned the right way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your honor, have a little respect! I spent the better part of two months working on that thing. Calling it an &lsquo;improvized&rsquo; explosive is just insulting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, your honor, I didn&rsquo;t really mind that she got the kids. What pushed me over the edge is how she took the air fryer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your honor, I assure you that he put those cement shoes on his own feet, shot himself in the back of the head, and lept into the lake of his own accord.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your honor, I was innocent by reason of insanity. You would be too if you had to live with him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your honor, I assure you I was only driving one way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your honor, I&rsquo;m not a paranoid schizophrenic. The voices made that much clear!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh no, your honor, the person on that ID card is clearly me. I was just heavier then. And had a beard. And was five years older.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your honor, you don&rsquo;t understand. I did all the drinking <em>before</em> I started driving.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, your honor, I&rsquo;m not a lone shark. It&rsquo;s merely coincidence that all of my customers end up breaking their knee caps.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your honor, I know I stole that car, but you have to understand there were extenuating circumstances. Without it I would have been fifteen minutes late to that Taylor Swift concert!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With all due respect, your honor, what do you mean I was &lsquo;disturbing the peace?&rsquo; My music was only 108 decibels that night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your honor, it wasn&rsquo;t underage drinking. That child is 21 months old!&rdquo;</p>

      <title>Assorted Awful Advice</title>

      <description><![CDATA[<p><em>This page is written by Wilhelm Spurtendorf, lover of all things painful and frustrating.</em></p>
<p>Most of the time people seek out advice, it&rsquo;s because they want to get better at something. Pages upon pages of this sort of stuff can be found all over the internet. It&rsquo;s almost a damn deluge! Of course, this is all well and good for some people, but it&rsquo;s horrible for people like me: mascochists!</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t mean watered down, trendy masochism - the kind where you just want to pretend your girlfriend is an Arab slave trader and have her pretend you&rsquo;re a <em>pi√±ata.</em> No, I mean hardcore, traditional masochism, the kind where you make your mission in life experiencing as much gratuitous suffering as possible. Being a member of this demographic, I&rsquo;ve always noticed how we&rsquo;re excluded from this hedonormative society, and especially from places where hedonormative people give advice. They just assume everyone doesn&rsquo;t want to experience suffering and failure!</p>
<p>To mend this gaping hole in the online landscape, I&rsquo;ve begun curating a series of articles with the goal of helping you live the most unpleasant, painful, and downright miserable life you possibly can, all with the help of some of the world&rsquo;s greatest givers of terrible advice.</p>

      <title>The Many Problems of Jack</title>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>The homeschool co - op I attended in High School had many idiosyncrasies, but one of its most memorable is how we were forced to present math problems before our classmates. Sometimes these were taken out of textbooks or off of the internet, but more often we invented them ourselves (frequently on the drive over to school or during lunch). Mostly, their narratives were <em>really boring</em>! As if the were learning math or something.</p>
<p>But my friend Jack and I, being smartasses of a theatrical bent, chose to tell an increasingly ridiculous story with him as the protagonist. At first Jack was stealing his mother&rsquo;s wedding ring &amp; pirating Nintendo games, but soon he was convincing the passerby to worship Jimmy Wales &amp; questing through Hell.</p>
<p>Why we were allowed to continue, especially as I began to satirize our teachers&rsquo; conservative &amp; conspiratorial views about politics &amp; religion, is a great mystery. I don&rsquo;t claim they&rsquo;re the best jokes ever written &ndash; a couple of them make me cringe now that I&rsquo;m (mostly) an adult. But, plenty of them are still funny, and I&rsquo;m proud I wrote them in high school. A few people wanted an archive of them, and part of me felt like sharing. So, here we are.</p>
<p><em>Real people also appear in the Math Problems often, and how they are portrayed has very little to do with their actual behavior. People Jack and I knew personally appeared in the problems with their consent, and they usually chose in which roles they would be appearing. Some names have been changed or omitted entirely.</em></p>

      <title>Half Empty or Half Full? Philosophers respond.</title>
      <link>//localhost:1313/humor/glass/phil/</link>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>In our quest to find out whether the glass was half empty or half full, we first asked the world&rsquo;s great philosophers. Here are their responses.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Leibniz says: This is the fullest of all possible glasses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Schopenhauer says: Everything sucks, including the glass.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thales says: The glass is completely full because the air in the top half is also water.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The mereological nihilist says: There is no glass.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The ontological nihilist says: I couldn&rsquo;t have said it better than the previous guy, except what I think doesn&rsquo;t stop sounding crazy if I spend fifteen minutes explaining it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Aristotle says: The glass is actually half empty but possesses the potentiality to be half full.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Anselm says: In using this vessel as part of thine shitty comedy operation, thou hast offended its unfathomably great honor. (<em>sighs</em>) Looks like we&rsquo;re gonna have to set you on fire, bud.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The logical positivist says: Your question is not only extremely annoying but also utterly meaningless.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Michael Huemer says: It just seems really obvious that the glass is half full.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The panpsychist says: Why don&rsquo;t you just ask him, man?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Plato says: The glass halfway participates in the form of fullness.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>John Rawls says: The glass would agree to be half full.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Spinoza says: On God or nature, you brought me back to life just to ask me that?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The solipsist says: The glass doesn&rsquo;t exist and neither do you. Oh, you disagree with that? That&rsquo;s just what a nonexistent person would say.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lance Bush says: The notion of a &ldquo;full glass&rdquo; is completely unintelligible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The analytic philosopher says: Okay, let&rsquo;s unpack this a little &hellip; [begins a seven hour monologue discussing the precise usage of the terms involved and their history, making heavy use of symbolic logic and Bayes&rsquo; Theorem all the while. His conclusion: &ldquo;I dunno bro, it&rsquo;s probably just semantics or something.&rdquo;]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The continental philosopher says: Hark upon the serendipitous quintessence with which we must congitate upon such a query - multitudinous intrepid spirits hath ruminated upon this antique problem passim the eons; for the portion of this individuated subjectivity, think he that the chalice mays perchance be halfway empty - if considered from a certain point of view, but that, in pure disreflective beingness - if perchance such a thing might there be - the query musts finally remain unanswered; or perhaps there is no that such to be gobbledegooked; perchance instead it be that gobbledebooking shall not maintain apace of the clandestine ruminations liken to &hellip; [he continues on like this for the next fifteen minutes, liberally using many obscure words and several he just made up (as well as all punctuation marks save periods). One of our interns gets the best sleep of her life. Towards the end he begins shouting in French, throws the glass out the window, and faints]</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>For good measure, we also reached out to several prominent politicians for their thoughts on the matter.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Kamala Harris says: It is in the Venn diagram of glasses which are half empty and glasses which are half full.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Donald Trump says: Half of this glass was stolen by brutal MS - 13 gang members, allowed to invade across our Southern border by the radical left. It&rsquo;s just horrible, horrible what they&rsquo;re doing to our country.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Joe Biden says: what you saying, Jack? &hellip; &ldquo;shabapaqoba?&rdquo; &hellip; Come on, man.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Marjorie Taylor Green says: DA JOOOS!!! DA JOOOS STOLE HALF OF THE GLASS!!! WITH THEIR WEATHER MACHINES!!! IT IS WRITTEN ON THE GUIDESTONES!!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Beto O&rsquo;Rourke says: [something obscene about cows. We daren&rsquo;t repeat it here]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kristie Noem says: I shot the glass.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>We also asked people of all faiths and no faith &ndash; God&rsquo;s gotta have something to say about the great questions of life, right?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The agnostic says: I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The strong agnostic says: You don&rsquo;t know.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The gnostic says: I know, and it makes me feel important, so you don&rsquo;t get to know.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The atheist says: &hellip; [excuse us, we appear to have contacted a brick by mistake &ndash; it lacks a belief in God]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Catholic says: I know that her accidents are those a glass, but in essence this object is obviously Natalie Portman. Damn &hellip; she&rsquo;s so hot &hellip; [looks at glass, eyes glaze over, and begins to drool]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The high - church Anglican says: OMG SISTER, you are SO RIGHT!!! SLAY QUEEN!!! [looks at Catholic, eyes glaze over, and begins to drool]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The low - church Anglican says: Nah girlies, that&rsquo;s too far. Like, the glass is def Natalie Portman, but she&rsquo;s just there in spirit or something.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Jew says: Huh? Why do you people think the glass is Natalie Portman?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Southern Baptist says: She isn&rsquo;t!!! They&rsquo;re wrong!!! It just commemorates her!!! Or something!!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Quaker says: Oh, it might be Natalie Portman, it might not, I don&rsquo;t really care.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An unnamed Presbyterian says: WHAT&rsquo;S WRONG WITH YOU PEOPLE?! You stand there, claiming that this is but a glass, but you know in your heart that it is Natalie Portman. Everybody out there, despite their claims to the contrary, knows perfectly well that this glass is Natalie Portman. [stands back, inclining his head slightly, admiring his unmatched powers to read minds.]</p>
