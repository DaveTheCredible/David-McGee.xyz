<p>“Oh, so like, are you going to do anything to stop us from leaving Heck?”</p>
<p>“Nah, we’re too tired. There ain&rsquo;t no coffee in Heck. There’s a carriage over there which will take you back to the mortal world. It’s pulled by a haggard, undead mare named Star in the Morning Sky (cause horse owners name their animals horrible names like that).”</p>
<p>So, Jack and his friends pile into the carriage and return to the mortal world and do battle with the archons.</p>
