<p>I&rsquo;m Dr. Jim Stanford (PhD), and I have some alarming news for you. Almost 100% of people who die in house fires were not following my sleeping advice. The verdict of science is clear - whether or not you follow this simple five step program could be a matter of life and death. So, read carefully.</p>
<p><strong>1.) If you see a toilet in a dream, use that fella.</strong> Toilet use in dreams has a long and prestigious history, dating back to the times of the ancient Greeks. They believed that if you used a dream toilet, upcoming lottery numbers would be miraculously revealed to you. I can tell you this works from personal experience.</p>
<p><strong>2.) Never change your sheets.</strong> Cleaning your sheets is just so &hellip; unnatural. It drives away natural wonders like lice and body odor! How could anyone want that?</p>
<p><strong>3.) Ponder the deep questions of life while you try to sleep.</strong> How do we know anything at all? Is there a God? Does Becky want to sleep with you or is she just being nice? These questions and others have fascinated and confounded philosophers for centuries, and there&rsquo;s no better time to think about then than while you&rsquo;re a half - sleeping, melatonin drenched mess.</p>
<p><strong>4.) Cook recipes revealed to you in dreams.</strong> The ancestral spirits occasionally reveal recipes to people while deep in sleep. They are always delicious, cheap, and filled with vitamins!</p>
<p><strong>5.) Attempt to sleep in a large American city.</strong> Large American cities are the most lovely sleeping locales of them all. The musical sounds of noisy machinery, people yelling, and gun violence will lull you to sleep, guaranteed.</p>
