<p>Hey, y&rsquo;all, name&rsquo;s Zippity, and I&rsquo;m gonna learn you the right way to drive them cars. And I ain&rsquo;t talking about that BS they teach youngins out them driving schools - I&rsquo;m talking about the real deal. You follow them&rsquo;s advice, and you&rsquo;ll be one of them sheep who drives below the speed limit. You listen to my ten step program, and you&rsquo;ll be a certified ʀᴏᴀᴅᴡᴀʀʀɪᴏʀ - unchallenged ruler of the highway.</p>
<p><strong>1.) Cuss at them other drivers.</strong> Look out at all those SOBs around you - having the audacity to be there all over your road, getting you stuck in traffic, driving around in their ugly - ass smartcars, cutting you off. It just makes me sick. Most of us suppress our disgust at them, but you shouldn&rsquo;t. Mamma ain&rsquo;t listening and you ain&rsquo;t in no church, so give into your anger. Work yourself up into a frenzy of spiritual excitement like a Pentecostal minister speaking in tongues, let obscenities erupt from your mouth like magma from Mount Saint Hellens. Let those bastards know that this is <strong>your</strong> road.</p>
<p><strong>2. Remember you always have that right of way.</strong> Them &ldquo;teachers&rdquo; of driving in this world want you to believe that you don&rsquo;t always have the right of way. Who the hell do they think they are? You&rsquo;re the ʀᴏᴀᴅᴡᴀʀʀɪᴏʀ for Heaven&rsquo;s sake! This is your road, if one of them trespassers thinks otherwise, let him know thy fury!</p>
<p><strong>3.) Throw them turtle shells at cars in front of you.</strong> This is a trick invented by a noted Italian ʀᴏᴀᴅᴡᴀʀʀɪᴏʀ. Though any turtle shells will work fine, blue ones are ideal.</p>
<p><strong>4.) Drink them beers while you&rsquo;re driving.</strong> I&rsquo;ll tell you a little secret, child. After you&rsquo;s been driving for a while, it just stops being that hard. But, a true ʀᴏᴀᴅᴡᴀʀʀɪᴏʀ never takes the easy path, so you&rsquo;ll need something to add another degree of difficulty. This is where alcohol comes in.</p>
<p><strong>5.) Give them coppers the bird.</strong> I swan, them coppers are <em>the most</em> exasperating sons of bitches on God&rsquo;s flat earth! They&rsquo;ll take some random, unassuming guy, pull him over, and take away his licence for three months because I was going 95 in the suburbs of Mobile! Wait &hellip; Editor, cut that part out!</p>
<p><strong>6.) Put them controversial bumper stickers on your car.</strong> You can&rsquo;t just be driving around like one of them sheeple who don&rsquo;t wanna offend nobody - you&rsquo;re the dad - burn ʀᴏᴀᴅᴡᴀʀʀɪᴏʀ! You&rsquo;ve gotta piss off those other fellas. They&rsquo;re on your road so they deserve it! Best way to do this is to put as many offensive bumper stickers on your car as possible! Put a Confederate flag there, put one up about black power, add a little something - something about gay people &hellip; you get the picture.</p>
<p><strong>7.) Ignore them check engine lights.</strong> Check engine lights were put there by the insurance companies to get you to take your car in more often than it needs. They&rsquo;re just useless!</p>
<p><strong>8.) Collect them catalytic converters from your fallen enemies.</strong> If you&rsquo;re a good ʀᴏᴀᴅᴡᴀʀʀɪᴏʀ, then you&rsquo;ll have rammed into many sissy smartcars. Usually there ain&rsquo;t nothing of value to salvage from them, but every so often you can salvage a catalytic converter and make bank.</p>
<p><strong>9.) Remember that you are a sovereign citizen.</strong> This is a good thing to bring up when them coppers come after you. The government is actually a bankrupt corporation, and you don&rsquo;t owe them nothing.</p>
<p><strong>10.) Piss into that gas tank of yours.</strong> This is a great way to way to avoid having to pay for or siphon gas. Sufficiently alcoholic piss is a real good fuel substitute, and it should be sufficiently alcoholic if you follow step four regularly.</p>
