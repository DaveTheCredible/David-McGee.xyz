      <description><![CDATA[<p>Jack and his crew steal Elon Musk&rsquo;s fastest UFO and return once more to the Earth. They land on Jeffery Epstein&rsquo;s island - now restored to its previous glory - to find Joe Biden and Bill Clinton standing in front of the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What the hell kid?&rdquo; asks Bill Clinton. &ldquo;I thought you died!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was once slain, but now I live. I am Jack, conqueror of death!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bill is about to respond, but he&rsquo;s cut off by the other archon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shabapaduba?&rdquo; Joe Biden questions, gesturing vaguely towards Kaegan with a befuddled expression on his face. &ldquo;I-I coulda sworn, man. That right there is Corn Pop! He&rsquo;s a bad dude, usedta run a buncha bad boys&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kaegan throws up his hands. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know bro. I ain&rsquo;t named Corn Pop. There are 8 billion people in the world and only one corn pop. I probably ain&rsquo;t him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biden grows angry and begins foaming at the mouth. &ldquo;Come on man! You ain&rsquo;t black, you lying, dog - faced pony soldier! You&rsquo;re a Corn Pop &lsquo;cause I says you&rsquo;re a Corn Pop!&rdquo; The politician throws his head back in anger and thrusts forwards his right hand. &ldquo;BIDEN BLAST!&rdquo; he screams in fury, causing a blue pulse of energy to arc between his hand and Kaegan, - reducing the later to a pile of ashes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; Screams Hayden. &ldquo;They killed Kaegan!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You bastards!&rdquo; I echo.</p>
<p>Fury begins rising in Jack&rsquo;s bosom, fury like he&rsquo;s never felt before. His eyes glow red with wrath - the wrath of the god emperor of mankind. The Earth begins to shake and thunder roles. &ldquo;Lɪsᴛᴇɴ ᴜᴘ, sᴏᴄɪᴀʟɪsᴛ sᴄᴜᴍ!&rdquo; outpours an otherworldly, ferocious voice quite unlike his own. &ldquo;Yᴏᴜ&rsquo;ᴠᴇ ᴋɪʟʟᴇᴅ Kᴇᴀɢᴀɴ, ʙᴜᴛ ʜᴇ ᴡᴀsɴ&rsquo;ᴛ ᴛʜᴇ ꜰɪʀsᴛ! I ᴋɴᴏᴡ ᴛʜᴇ ʜɪsᴛᴏʀʏ ᴏꜰ ʏᴏᴜʀ sᴏᴄɪᴀʟɪsᴍ! I ᴋɴᴏᴡ ᴛʜᴇ ᴡᴏʀᴅs ʏᴏᴜ ᴄᴀɴ&rsquo;ᴛ sᴛᴀɴᴅ ᴛᴏ ʜᴇᴀʀ, ᴛʜᴇ ᴡᴏʀᴅs ᴛʜᴀᴛ ᴇxᴏʀᴄɪsᴇ ᴀɴʏ ʟɪʙᴇʀᴀʟ ғʀᴏᴍ ᴛʜɪs ᴍᴏʀᴛᴀʟ ᴘʟᴀɴᴇ!</p>
<p><em><strong>&ldquo;ɪPʜᴏɴᴇ! &hellip;</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>&hellip; Vᴇɴᴇᴢᴜᴇʟᴀ! &hellip;</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>&hellip; ONE HUNDRED &hellip;</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>&hellip; UNDECILLION &hellip;</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>&hellip; DDDEEEAAADDD!!!!&rdquo;</strong></em></p>
<p>The fiends cover their ears, trying to shield themselves from those fateful, ruinous words. But, it is to no avail. They begin screeching in pain, and soon are melting away like the Nazis at the end of <em>Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark.</em></p>
<p>Jack sighs. &ldquo;Another cuck leftist destroyed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p>If socialism killed 100 undecillion people, as Jack proved with facts and logic, and there are 8 billion people in the world right now (as Kaegan stated), then how many orders of magnitude more people has socialism killed then are alive today?</p>

      <title>Math Problem Thirty-Eight: Tesla Man - Least of the Archons</title>
      <link>//localhost:1313/humor/math/38/</link>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>At the crack of Philip&rsquo;s whip, Star in the Morning Sky begins lumbering forwards on her borderline defunct legs. As she reaches 8.8 miles per hour, Jack and his company enter the tunnel of light once more. As they go forward, Jack ceases to be the disembodied ghost he has been, and finds himself arrayed as the god - emperor of mankind once more. His triceps swell, he gains the abs of an anime tomboy, and golden armor covers his body.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait, something&rsquo;s wrong!&rdquo; Philip declares with manly yet apprehensive perturbance. &ldquo;Earth isn&rsquo;t up ahead! This darned horse is taking us to the moon!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But, before Philip can stop anything, the tunnel of light vanishes, and the carriage grinds to a halt on solid, firmly material ground. Jack closes his eyes, expecting to die like an imposter thrown out of the airlock. But, he doesn&rsquo;t. He breathes in and slowly opens his eyes, finding himself still very much alive.</p>
<p>They step outside the carriage to find themselves in a hideous moon base, made entirely of plastic - exactly like every generic spaceship on TV.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What the hell is going on! Wikipedia doesn&rsquo;t say anything about there being a base like this on the moon!&rdquo; says Jimmy Wales.</p>
<p>A strange, A.I. generated cackling sounds behind them. &ldquo;Ha. Ha. Ha. You are fools.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack turns around wildly and draws his sword, but he only sees an expensive - looking Tesla car. But then, its parts begin shifting into a new form - the form of a huge man made of plastic and steel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like zoinks! It&rsquo;s a transformer!&rdquo; Shaggy proclaims.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Before my augmentation, I was called Elon Musk, and I am the least of the archons. How dare you trespass on my moon base?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait, this is totally fake!&rdquo; I say. &ldquo;How come no one found this place when people went to the moon? There has to be a naturalistic explanation for this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no one ever went to the moon. This is where UFOs hail from, and it has been so since the time of the ancient Egyptians. To keep the mortals from discovering them, they were forbidden from coming to the moon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just as I am about to respond, Jimmy Wales jumps into action and begins doing battle with Elon Musk - quoting negative statistics about spaceX and Tesla all the while. The fight is long, hard, and brutal. But, in the end, the African American businessman falls to his knees in subjection.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! You may have defeated me, but you cannot defeat the other archons! You are on the road to destruction! All of your base are belong to us! The others are gathered at Jeffry Epstein&rsquo;s island, and they will summon the antichrist in 37 minutes, bringing about the end times. My fastest UFO will get you there in 27 minutes. How long, pray tell, will that leave you to fight them?&rdquo;</p>

      <title>Half Empty or Half Full? Philosophers respond.</title>
      <link>//localhost:1313/humor/glass/phil/</link>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>In our quest to find out whether the glass was half empty or half full, we first asked the world&rsquo;s great philosophers. Here are their responses.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Leibniz says: This is the fullest of all possible glasses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Schopenhauer says: Everything sucks, including the glass.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thales says: The glass is completely full because the air in the top half is also water.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The mereological nihilist says: There is no glass.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The ontological nihilist says: I couldn&rsquo;t have said it better than the previous guy, except what I think doesn&rsquo;t stop sounding crazy if I spend fifteen minutes explaining it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Aristotle says: The glass is actually half empty but possesses the potentiality to be half full.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Anselm says: In using this vessel as part of thine shitty comedy operation, thou hast offended its unfathomably great honor. (<em>sighs</em>) Looks like we&rsquo;re gonna have to set you on fire, bud.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The logical positivist says: Your question is not only extremely annoying but also utterly meaningless.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Michael Huemer says: It just seems really obvious that the glass is half full.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The panpsychist says: Why don&rsquo;t you just ask him, man?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Plato says: The glass halfway participates in the form of fullness.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>John Rawls says: The glass would agree to be half full.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Spinoza says: On God or nature, you brought me back to life just to ask me that?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The solipsist says: The glass doesn&rsquo;t exist and neither do you. Oh, you disagree with that? That&rsquo;s just what a nonexistent person would say.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lance Bush says: The notion of a &ldquo;full glass&rdquo; is completely unintelligible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The analytic philosopher says: Okay, let&rsquo;s unpack this a little &hellip; [begins a seven hour monologue discussing the precise usage of the terms involved and their history, making heavy use of symbolic logic and Bayes&rsquo; Theorem all the while. His conclusion: &ldquo;I dunno bro, it&rsquo;s probably just semantics or something.&rdquo;]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The continental philosopher says: Hark upon the serendipitous quintessence with which we must congitate upon such a query - multitudinous intrepid spirits hath ruminated upon this antique problem passim the eons; for the portion of this individuated subjectivity, think he that the chalice mays perchance be halfway empty - if considered from a certain point of view, but that, in pure disreflective beingness - if perchance such a thing might there be - the query musts finally remain unanswered; or perhaps there is no that such to be gobbledegooked; perchance instead it be that gobbledebooking shall not maintain apace of the clandestine ruminations liken to &hellip; [he continues on like this for the next fifteen minutes, liberally using many obscure words and several he just made up (as well as all punctuation marks save periods). One of our interns gets the best sleep of her life. Towards the end he begins shouting in French, throws the glass out the window, and faints]</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>We also asked people of all faiths and no faith &ndash; God&rsquo;s gotta have something to say about the great questions of life, right?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The agnostic says: I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The strong agnostic says: You don&rsquo;t know.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The gnostic says: I know, and it makes me feel important, so you don&rsquo;t get to know.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The atheist says: &hellip; [excuse us, we appear to have contacted a brick by mistake &ndash; it lacks a belief in God]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Catholic says: I know that her accidents are those a glass, but in essence this object is obviously Natalie Portman. Damn &hellip; she&rsquo;s so hot &hellip; [looks at glass, eyes glaze over, and begins to drool]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The high - church Anglican says: OMG SISTER, you are SO RIGHT!!! SLAY QUEEN!!! [looks at Catholic, eyes glaze over, and begins to drool]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The low - church Anglican says: Nah girlies, that&rsquo;s too far. Like, the glass is def Natalie Portman, but she&rsquo;s just there in spirit or something.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Jew says: Huh? Why do you people think the glass is Natalie Portman?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Southern Baptist says: She isn&rsquo;t!!! They&rsquo;re wrong!!! It just commemorates her!!! Or something!!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Quaker says: Oh, it might be Natalie Portman, it might not, I don&rsquo;t really care.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An unnamed Presbyterian says: WHAT&rsquo;S WRONG WITH YOU PEOPLE?! You stand there, claiming that this is but a glass, but you know in your heart that it is Natalie Portman. Everybody out there, despite their claims to the contrary, knows perfectly well that this glass is Natalie Portman. [stands back, inclining his head slightly, admiring his unmatched powers to read minds.]</p>
</li>
</ul>
