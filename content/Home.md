Hello World! My name is David, and this is my small corner of the internet. 

I'm an American geoscience student, but I enjoy writing and fictional cartography in my spare time. At the moment, I've only uploaded a few pieces of comedy and satire onto this website, but I'll probably upload fiction and essays in the future.
