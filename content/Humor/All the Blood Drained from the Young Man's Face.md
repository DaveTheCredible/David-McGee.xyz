For a while, the Christian apologist Frank Turek would occasionally repost this tweet:

![All the blood drained from the young man's face](/blood.png)

Whether this story is real or apocryphal, Turek is making a *very serious* point. Many young people abandon Christianity, or at least its historic positions about sexual morality, on account of the Horny.

But, I confess I've always found the Tweet a little hilarious. And I think it deserves to be parodied and dramatically read until Kingdom come. I've gotten us started, but don't let that stop you from pitching in!
