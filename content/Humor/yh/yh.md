"No, your honor, I didn't really mind that she got the kids. What pushed me over the edge is how she took the air fryer."

"Your honor, I know the light was red, but I only turned the right way."

"Your honor, you don't understand. I did all the drinking *before* I started driving."

"Your honor, have a little respect! I spent six months working on that thing. Calling it an 'improvized' explosive is just insulting."

"Your honor, I assure you that he put those cement shoes on his own feet, shot himself in the back of the head, and leapt into the lake of his own accord."

"Your honor, I am innocent by reason of insanity. You would be too if you had to live with him."

"But your honor, I only purchased those five hundred pounds of fertilizer because it tastes so damn good!"

"Your honor, I assure you I was only driving one way."

"Your honor, I know I'm on the no - fly list, but I was clearly wearing basketball shorts."

"Your honor, I'm not a paranoid schizophrenic. The voices made that much clear!"

"No, your honor, I'm not a lone shark. It's merely coincidence that all of my customers end up breaking their knee caps."

"Your honor, I know I stole that car, but you have to understand there were extenuating circumstances. Without it I would have been fifteen minutes late to Taylor Swift!"

"Your honor, it wasn't underage drinking. That child is 21 months old!"
