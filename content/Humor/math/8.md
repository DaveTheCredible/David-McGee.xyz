Jack asks Chase if he can help him escape the Men in Black. Chase offers to let Jack escape down the secret tunnel he uses to traffic fursuits from Mazatlán, Mexico to Denver, Colorado. 

If Denver is 1142 miles away from Mazatlán, and if Chase's lover dug through five miles of dirt a week, how many days did it take for the tunnel to be completed? If Chase could also dig through five miles of dirt, how much faster could they have finished the tunnel if he had been doing that instead of playing Call of Duty?
