Jack and his companions see a great black lake in front of them, on the other side of which lie the circles of Heck dedicated to degenerate high school students. At first they think it is impassable, but then they see a motorboat sitting there. Philip, who knows the way Heck works very well, says that this is how they’re meant to cross. So, they all get into it and start sailing. At first, all seems well, but then they are overcome with a putrid, horrible smell. All of them fall over with tears in their eyes except for Philip, who maintains his stoic calm. 

“What’s like, happening dude?” Shaggy asks through his coughs and tears.

“That is the stench of the degenerates.” Responds Philip. “Every fifteen minutes, 0.8% of the air we breathe becomes replaced by the horrid stench of the next circle of Heck. If we will only reach 100% degenerate stench when we are on the other side of the sea, how long will it be?”
