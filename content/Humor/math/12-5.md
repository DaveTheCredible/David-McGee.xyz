Jack backward long jumps many times, and then he stops. All of the force hits
him immediately. He sees the parallel universes laid out before him and is
aware of his traversing them. Then, a second later, he is on the ground in
another world. 

Jack feels in his bones that his ex wife is close. After just a few minutes of
searching, he sees her: his nemesis. It was she that got him addicted to heroin
tricked him into stealing his mothers wedding ring. Jack's power blazes forth.
His laser eyes begin to power up and he raises his sword. But, he hesitates. It
would be terribly cruel to destroy his ex this way. So instead, like a certain
long forgotten Zelda boss, she is cast into the gap between dimensions.
