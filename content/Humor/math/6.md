The Grim Reaper checked Jack's Wikipedia page just after Jimmy Wales edited it. Thus, he let Jack escape his bloody scythe. The prison faculty still thought that he was dead, though, so they took him to the morgue. Jack wakes up on the autopsy table five hours later and sees a lab aid with his back turned, apparently preparing to cut him open. Jacks takes great offense at this, so he sneaks up on this sorry fellow and knocks him unconscious, robbing him of his car keys and fancy lab coat in the process. Pretending to be the lab aid, Jack sneaks into the parking garage and gets in his victim's car. 

When the government hears about Jack, they believe he is a paranormal phenomenon, so they send the men in black after him. It took 5 hours before the report reached the director of the men in black, and it takes a further 5 hours to prepare their black helicopter, which is 522 miles behind Jack and can move at 122 an hour. Jack exited the crime lab 231 miles from his buddy Chase's house, and Jack decided to seek refuge with him. Jack stole a bad car and thus can only drive at a maximum of 75 miles an hour. Will Jack get to Chase's house before the men in black can get to him?
