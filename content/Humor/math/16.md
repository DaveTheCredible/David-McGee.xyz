The tax man flies off into the night at a breakneck speed and passes over the horizon. Suddenly, Jack’s phone starts ringing, and he answers it.

“Jackie boy, I am Bill Clinton, and I know what you just did. I’m coming up there to learn you the right way to treat government officials.” 

Bill will be unable to start driving for thirty-six hours because his attractive female intern is visiting the dry cleaners’ in his car. Once he gets it back, Bill will start driving from his presidential library in Little Rock, Arkansas to Jack’s House in Belcarra, British Columbia. Belcarra and Little Rock are 2,396.69 Miles apart, and Bill Clinton will be driving at twenty miles per hour the whole way, making no stops. In how many days will Bill Clinton reach Jack?
