Jack and Shaggy find themselves in purgatory, which looks identical to rural Iowa. Corn stretches in all directions as far as the eye can see. 

“Like, where the zoinks are we supposed go dude?” Shaggy asks.

Queen Elizabeth II stumbles through the shoots of corn. "Tally-ho, young sir! What were you saying?” she asks.

“We’re on a mission from God that requires us to go through Heck, and we have no clue how to get there from here.”

“Well, Purgatory is the spiritual equivalent of the American corn-growing states, and Heck is much hotter than them, so I figure you have to just go south for a long time.” 

“How like, much corn is there here man?” Shaggy asks.

“Firstly, you must know the bizarre way Purgatory works. The landscape is almost entirely ripped from the American Midwest, but it had to be enlarged to accommodate many penetrant sinners, so that now it is 18^6 times larger than its counterpart in the world of the living, which is 610,080 square miles. If, on average, each acre produces 198 bushels of corn, and a square mile contains 640 acres, how many bushels of corn would there be? If every bushel of corn contains 90,000 kernels, how many kernels are there?”
