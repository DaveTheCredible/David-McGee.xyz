As it happens, one of the games Jack pirated contained a single sprite ripped from a Nintendo game. As soon as Shigeru Miyamoto was made aware of this vicious felony, he dispatched Nintendo's elite legal goons to deal with the young scoundrel. They quickly capture Jack and have him hauled before a grand jury to stand trial for his crimes against God, nature, and humanity. 

For every 17.75 people who torrented the game from Jack's website, he will be condemned to spend 48 years inside the ADX Florence Supermax Detention Center. If 18,427 people torrented the game from Jack's site, how many years will he be sentenced to spend in ADX Florence? If the average lifespan of an American male is 74.5 years, how many lifetimes will Jack be condemned to in ADX Florence?
