## Introduction

While the Christian home school co - op I attended in high school had many idiosyncrasies, one of the most memorable is how we were forced to read and complete math problems before our classmates. Sometimes these were taken out of textbooks or off of the internet, but more often we invented them ourselves (frequently during lunch or on the drive over to school). For the most part, their narratives were dull and utilitarian, like the point was supposed to be learning math or something.

But my friend Jack and I, being smartasses of a theatrical bent, took advantage of our captive audience to do something more amusing. Usually with his help and input, I started writing math problems about Jack committing crimes and evading the law. They were a big hit, partly because they were such a departure from normal math problems and partly because teenagers think anything mildly edgy is funny. Gradually, and partly because my teacher was a peeved that I was making jokes about criminal behavior, their subject matter became more bizarre and fantastical. Soon they came to incorporate such diverse things as a struggle with the IRS, a deified Jimmy Wales, various people we knew, a journey through H̶e̶l̶l̶ Heck, and mockery of various conspiracy theories. Why my teachers allowed them to continue, especially considering how I frequently sprinkled in blue humor and satirized their political beliefs, is a great mystery.

I don't claim they're the best jokes anyone has ever written, a couple of them make me cringe. But, plenty of them are still funny, and I continue to be happy I produced them in high school. A few people wanted an archive of them, and part of me felt like sharing. So, here we are.

*Real people appear in the Math Problems often, but it should be noted that how they are portrayed has very little to do with how their actual behavior. People Jack and I knew personally only appeared in the problems with their consent, and they usually chose in which roles they would be appearing.*
