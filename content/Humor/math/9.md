Jack travels through Chase's tunnel for a long time, eventually escaping to Mazatlán, Mexico. But, when he exits the tunnel, he sees what he wants. He sees what he needs. He sees a drug dealer passing out heroin. The temptation is too strong for Jack. Impulsively, almost instinctively, Jack moves toward him and asks for drugs. 

"¡No hablo ingles!" responds the other man, quién es totalmente hispanoablante. So, if Jack wants his drugs, he must learn Spanish. To this end, he steals a Spanish textbook from a nearby shop. If it takes him an average of thirteen hours to memorize a Spanish word (Jack has been near 5G towers recently and they have adversely impacted his brain), and he needs a thousand words to be conversational, how long will it take him to get there assuming he sleeps for 12 hours a night?
