Jack arrives at his buddy Chase's house. He knocks on the door, and Chase welcomes Jack into his home. Chase and his lover feed Jack dinner, and Jack happens to look at a computer that is open to Chase's Xbox account. Jack's old pal has spent 134,275 Hours playing Call of Duty. 

If it has been 20 years since Chase first picked up Call of Duty, what fraction of that time has he spent playing it?
