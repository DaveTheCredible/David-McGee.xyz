As Jack and his ever expanding band of merry men journey their way into the new circle of heck, they hear millions of people throwing up as one. As they come within sight of the darned here, they see a huge mass of pregnant women, all of whom appear to be deep in the throes of morning sickness.

"Dear God!" exclaims Jack "What brought them to this miserable state?"

Philip sighs. "This is where believers in feminism go - that doctrine which Pastor Jim declared leads women to leave their husbands, kill their babies, practice witchcraft, destroy capitalism, and become lesbians. In service of this false religion, the darned in this circle of Heck refused to be barefoot and pregnant housewives, so now they are forced to be both barefoot and pregnant ... unto eternal ages.

"Every woman born after 1993 has bought into feminism -- none of them can cook, all they know is McDonald's. If about half of people are women and two and a half billion people have been born since 1993, how many people will end up here?"
