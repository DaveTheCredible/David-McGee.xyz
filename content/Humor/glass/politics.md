For good measure, we also reached out to several prominent politicians for their thoughts on the matter.


* Donald Trump says: Half of this glass was stolen by brutal MS - 13 gang members, allowed to invade across our Southern border by the radical left -- I'm telling you, it's true. It's just horrible, horrible what they've done to our country.

* Joe Biden says: what you saying, Jack? ... "shabapaqoba?" ... Come on, man.

* Kamala Harris says: Hehe -- it's in the Venn diagram of glasses which are half empty and glasses which are half full -- hehe.

* Marjorie Taylor Green says: THE JEWS STOLE HALF OF THE GLASS WITH THEIR WEATHER MACHINES!! IT IS WRITTEN ON THE GUIDESTONES!!

* Beto O'Rourke says: [something obscene about cows. We daren't repeat it here]

* Kristie Noem says: I shot the glass.
