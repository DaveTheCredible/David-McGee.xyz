In our quest to figure out whether the glass is half empty or half full, we interviewed several people of all faiths and no faith -- God's gotta have something to say about the great questions of life, right?

* The agnostic says: I don't know.

* The strong agnostic says: You don't know.

* The gnostic says: I know, and it makes me feel important, so you don't get to know.

* The atheist says: ... [excuse us, we appear to have contacted a brick by mistake -- it lacks a belief in God]

* The Catholic says: I know that her accidents are those a glass, but in essence this object is obviously Natalie Portman. Damn ... she's so hot ... [looks at glass, eyes glaze over, and begins to drool]

* The high - church Anglican says: OMG SISTER, you are SO RIGHT!!! SLAY QUEEN!!! [looks at Catholic, eyes glaze over, and begins to drool]

* The low - church Anglican says: Nah girlies, that's too far. Like, the glass is def Natalie Portman, but she's just there in spirit or something.

* The Jew says: Huh? Why do you people think the glass is Natalie Portman?

* The Southern Baptist says: She isn't!!! They're wrong!!! It just commemorates her!!! Or something!!!
