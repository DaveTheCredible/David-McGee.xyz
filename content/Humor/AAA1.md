*This page is written by Wilhelm Spurtendorf, lover of all things painful and frustrating.*

Most of the time people seek out advice, it's because they want to get better at something. Pages upon pages of this sort of stuff can be found all over the internet. It's almost a damn deluge! Of course, this is all well and good for some people, but it's horrible for people like me: mascochists! 

I don't mean watered down, trendy masochism - the kind where you just want to pretend your girlfriend is an Arab slave trader and have her pretend you're a *pi√±ata.* No, I mean hardcore, traditional masochism, the kind where you make your mission in life experiencing as much gratuitous suffering as possible. Now, I'll admit some advice on the internet might make you're life a living Hell, but that'd always be an unhappy side effect!

To mend this gaping hole in the online landscape, I've begun curating a series of articles with the goal of helping you live the most unpleasant, painful, and downright miserable life you possibly can, all with the help of some of the world's greatest givers of terrible advice.
