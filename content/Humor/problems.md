The homeschool co - op I attended in High School had many idiosyncrasies, but one of its most memorable is how we were forced to present math problems before our classmates. Sometimes these were taken out of textbooks or off of the internet, but more often we invented them ourselves (frequently while our classmates presented theirs). Mostly, their narratives were *really boring!* As if the point were learning math or something ...

But my friend Jack and I, being smartasses of a theatrical bent, chose to tell an increasingly ridiculous story with him as the protagonist. At first Jack was stealing his mother's wedding ring & pirating Nintendo games, but soon he was convincing the passerby to worship Jimmy Wales and interacting with conspiracy theories.

I haven't the damnedest idea why we were allowed to continue, especially as they began to not - so subtly criticise the conspiracy theories my teachers believed. It probably reflects an admirable ability to laugh at themselves.

I can't claim they're the best jokes ever written -- a couple of them make me cringe now. But, I still find most of them funny, and I'm proud to have written them in high school. A few people wanted an archive of them, and part of me felt like sharing. So, here we are.

*Persons living and dead regularly appear in the math problems. But, unless they were public figures, it was always with their continuous and enthusiastic consent. Their depicted behavior has very little to do with their real personalities; some names have been changed or omitted entirely.*
